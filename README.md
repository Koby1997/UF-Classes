This is just a place I decided to put any code related projects I had made while in college. The later classes I decided to just put most of the files I had even if they weren't code becasue the projects were bigger and involved more research or resources. Some parts are not well organized as I just threw in anything I thought might be helpful if I look back in the future. Don't listen to Github about what languages are here, it is not all C++. There is:

Java, C, C++, MATLAB, VHDL, SQL, Javascript, Assembly, and probably some other languages but very little.
